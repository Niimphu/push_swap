# libft

Status: complete

Grade: 125%

Observations: In this project, I relearned a lot of techniques on string and pointer manipulation that I had forgotten since the 42 Piscine, as well as writing recursive functions and using malloc() properly. The functions I struggled the most with were: ft_memset(), ft_memmove(), ft_split() and ft_itoa(). Some of the problems I ran into most often were incrementing/decrementing indices at the wrong time/place or for the wrong amount, which I will try to avoid in the future with proper debugging, and managing memory or pointers improperly, resulting in leaks or incorrect pointers. Overall, this project was a lot of learning and a rewarding experience.
